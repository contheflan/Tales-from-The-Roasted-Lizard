## Overview

**Tales from The Roasted Lizard** 

*The wind howls and the drains swell with the heavy rainfall. You pull your collar up over your face as the cold bites your nose. Pushing your way through an especially crowded market district, your eyes level on your destination. A steady stream of patrons flow in and out of the large wooden doors under a bright green and yellow sign. "THE ROASTED LIZARD INN: Drink and Quests inquire within" You tighten your grip on your sword and mutter a protection ward as you push through the rainsoaked flow of patrons into the smoke filled tavern.*

Ever need a quest? Have an interesting plot hook, story premise, or a fun campaign idea? Let the notice board at the Lizard satisfy your hunger for adventure (and food)! The idea is simple, post a quest idea or story premise and have your fellow tavern patrons (or users) vote and comment on which ones they like! Maybe you can collaborate together to fine-tune some interesting story ideas.

## MVP

_The **Project Title** MVP lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum. Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex. In quis fringilla velit, ac maximus quam. Etiam eget placerat neque. Aenean faucibus sem non nisi lobortis ullamcorper._

<br>

### Goals

- Have a working interactive React App
- 8, Fully styled components 
- Have a database with 3 seperate tables
- _Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex._
- _etc._

### Libraries and Dependencies

> Use this section to list all supporting libraries and dependencies, and their role in the project. Below is an example - this needs to be replaced!

|     Library      | Description                                |
| :--------------: | :----------------------------------------- |
|      React       | Front end Framework |
|   React Router   | Routes/Links/withRouter |
| Axios | API |
|     Rails      | Backend |
|  CORS  | Handles outside requests|

<br>

### Client (Front End)

#### Wireframes

> Use the Wireframes section to display desktop, tablet and mobile views. No hand-drawn wireframes. Use a tool like wireframe.cc, Whimsical or AdobeXD

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. 

#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to include a link to your component tree.

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

<br>

### Server (Back End)

#### ERD Model

> Use this section to display an image of a computer generated ERD model. You can use draw.io, Lucidchart or another ERD tool.

## Post-MVP

> Use this section to document ideas you've had that would be fun (or necessary) for your Post-MVP. This will be helpful when you return to your project after graduation!

***

## Code Showcase

> Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of and a brief description.

## Code Issues & Resolutions

> Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.
